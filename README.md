## Features

- **Trustless Cross-Chain Swaps**: Securely exchange assets across different blockchains without the need for intermediaries.
- **AI Agent Management**: Register AI agent prompts as NFTs and manage them using Story Network.
- **Licensing and Royalties**: Mint license tokens, create derivatives, and reward original creators through a royalties module.
- **License Lending System**: Lend license tokens to other users within the network.
- **Custom Prediction Market**: A bespoke prediction market deployed on Flow Blockchain, optimized for consumer engagement.

## Architecture

### Lit Protocol for Cross-Chain Swaps

- **Programmable Key Pairs**: Creates key pairs on each chain that monitor asset reception.
- **Trustless Execution**: Waits for assets on both chains before executing swaps.
- **Lit Actions**: Produces signed transactions to complete cross-chain transfers.

### Story Network for AI Agents

- **NFT Registration**: AI agent prompts are registered as NFTs.
- **Licensing**: Users can mint license tokens to implement or derive new agents.
- **Royalties Module**: Original creators receive rewards from derivatives.
- **Lending System**: License token holders can lend their licenses to others.

### Prediction Market on Flow Blockchain

The prediction market is held in another contract

- **Custom Deployment**: Tailored prediction market leveraging Flow's consumer-focused infrastructure.
- **User Engagement**: Designed for ease of use and accessibility.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies with Yarn**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

This project utilizes **Hardhat** and **Foundry** for development and testing.

### Hardhat

Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software.

- **Compile Contracts**

  ```bash
  npx hardhat compile
  ```

- **Run Tests**

  ```bash
  npx hardhat test
  ```

- **Deploy Contracts**

  ```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network network_name
  ```

### Foundry

Foundry is a blazing fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development.

- **Build Contracts**

  ```bash
  forge build
  ```

- **Run Tests**

  ```bash
  forge test
  ```

## Technologies Used

- **Lit Protocol**: For trustless execution of cross-chain swaps.
- **Story Network**: Manages AI agent data and licensing.
- **Flow Blockchain**: Hosts the custom prediction market.
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment.
- **Foundry**: Toolkit for Ethereum application development.
- **Yarn**: Package management and project setup.
